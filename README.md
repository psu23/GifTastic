### Overview

In this application, the GIPHY API was  to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

Technologies used:
* JavaScript 
* jQuery
* HTML5
* CSS3


### Instructions

1. In this app, the user chooses a theme of gifs they want to see, searches for it, and creates a button of this theme.

2. After clicking on the button of a theme, the app generates 10 gifs of that theme (the first 10 gifs from the GIPHY API for that call at a given time).

3. Initially, theses gifs are static, but if the user clicks on one, it will animate. Clicking on it again will make the animation static.

4. The user can see the ratings of each gif below them

5. The user can also save their favorite gifs by clickin on the star beneath it, and it will get added to a 'favorites' section above the generated gifs.
